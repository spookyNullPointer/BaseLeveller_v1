## Status

Currently in active development. Very limited functionality.

TODO:

-  [] Acceptance Testing
-  [] Complete Stated Features


# Purpose 

This is a purely educational project with no underlining purpose but get practise at Java and OOP. In this project primarily consists of creating stored values and referencing them as well as some string searching via loops. First try at an independent test driven development using JUnit 5.

# Future Developments

Potential but unplanned developments would include using Regex for String searching and creation. The application is overly complicated using loops.

Potential features to include - 

- [] Basic UI for input / outputs
- [] Hexidecimal Conversion
- [] Octal
- [] Roman Numerals
